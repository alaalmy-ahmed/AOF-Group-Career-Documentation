# v2: the pipeline, rebuilt for reliability and scale

The original system (v1) is at the top of this repository, unchanged; git tag `v1` marks it. v2 rebuilds it step by step. Each step fixes a specific weakness in v1.

| Step | Status | What it changes |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Keys and constraints | In progress | A normalised schema the database itself keeps clean: [sql/001_schema.sql](sql/001_schema.sql) |
| 2. Safe re-runnable loads | Planned | |
| 3. Validation before loading | Planned | |
| 4. Notebooks → Python modules | Planned | |
| 5. Tests | Planned | |
| 6. Scheduling and alerts | Planned | |
| 7. dbt models | Planned | |
| 8. Replacing the Excel intake | Planned | |

## Step 1: the schema

| Table | One row per | Key | Points to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `managers` | Area manager | `manager_id`; `name` is unique | |
| `branches` | Branch | `code` (e.g. `B25`) | `managers` (current manager) |
| `meals` | Meal | `meal_id`; `name` is unique | |
| `scheduled_tasks` | Meal due on a date at a due time | `task_id`; `(task_date, meal_id, due_time)` is unique | `meals` |
| `task_misses` | Branch that missed a task | `(task_id, branch_code)` | `scheduled_tasks`, `branches` |
| `quality_issues` | Quality issue | `issue_id`; `(task_id, branch_code, description)` is unique | `scheduled_tasks`, `branches`, `managers` |

### What changed from v1, and why

| v1 | v2 | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `tasks` repeats the task's counts on every missed-branch row | `scheduled_tasks` (one row per task) + `task_misses` (one row per miss) | Each fact is stored once, so sums are correct without de-duplicating |
| `branch_missed = ''` when no branch missed | No row in `task_misses` | No placeholder values |
| `done_tasks`, `missed_tasks` | `branches_submitted`; misses are counted from `task_misses` | The names say what the numbers are, and nothing derivable is stored twice |
| Issues have no due time | Each issue points to its scheduled task (date, meal, due time) | A meal can be due twice a day; v1 couldn't tell those issues apart |
| Branch, meal and manager stored as free text | `branches` (keyed by code, e.g. `B25`), `meals` and `managers` tables, referenced by key | A typo or unknown value is rejected |
| No keys, no constraints | Primary keys, unique keys, foreign keys, checks | The database rejects duplicates, typos and impossible values by itself |

Kept from v1: the manager is stored on each issue when it's loaded. Branches are reassigned every month, so the load runs before each rotation and history keeps the manager responsible at the time.

The workbook stays as simple as it was for the data entry. The pipeline translates it into this model.
